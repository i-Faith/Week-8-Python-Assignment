# 📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis for Kenya, USA, and India

This project analyzes COVID-19 data using Python and presents insights through visualizations. It focuses on three countries: **Kenya**, **USA**, and **India**. The notebook demonstrates data collection, cleaning, analysis, and interactive visualization.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Covid_Analysis.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Data cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Visualizations (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- `owid-covid-data.csv` — Dataset sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) (you must download it manually).

## 🔧 Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3 and the following packages:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly

# Install via
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

# 🚀 How to Run
Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets

Place the dataset in the same folder as the notebook or adjust the file path accordingly.

Open Covid_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
